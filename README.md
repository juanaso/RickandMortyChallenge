# RickAndMortyApp! 

I present to you my approach to this particular challenge

The task I've choose to tackle, were only the mandatory ones, the user of this app will be able to scroll through the list of Character, choose one, see the details of the character and choose then you can access to that characters world location and can see the characters appearances.

What make this project special, is that it was made entirely with TDD as the development process, along side with modern Android practices, every screen the user sees was already tested using Espresso and Mockito.

to summarize, the technologies I've used to this project were the following:

TDD \
Clean Architecture \
MVVM \
Espresso (IU Test)\
Mockito (UnitTest)\
Retrofit (Network)\
Coroutines (Networks Flow)\
Hilt (Dependency Injector)\
JetpackNavigation (Navigation between Screens and State control)\
Glide (Display web Images)\
CustomViews\
Kotlin extensions \

to see it really Shine, open the project compile it, and them go to the RickAndMortyChallenge/app/src/androidTest/java/com/juanasoapp/rickandmortychallenge package, right click and click the option
"run tests"
then you'll se the magics of Espresso and TDD working together in order to make an scalable and test-safe app 

also you'll see all the test of the Viewmodels, repository, services in the package RickAndMortyChallenge/app/src/test/java/com/juanasoapp/rickandmortychallenge, you also can right click and click the option "run tests"

I Hope you had as much of a fun time reading and trying this project as I had making it!

-Engineer Juan Sulbaran.
